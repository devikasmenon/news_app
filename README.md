# News_app
The News App is a Python application designed to process news articles asynchronously, classify them into predefined categories, and store the results in a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes Celery for task queue management, NLTK for natural language processing, and SQLAlchemy for database interaction.

## Features
Asynchronous Processing: Celery is used to handle the asynchronous processing of news articles, allowing for parallel execution and scalability.
Article Classification: The application employs natural language processing techniques to classify news articles into predefined categories based on their content.
Database Integration: SQLAlchemy ORM facilitates interaction with a PostgreSQL database, enabling the storage of processed articles along with their assigned categories.
Modularity: The application is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and customization of the classification logic and database schema.
## Setup
Dependencies Installation: Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Database Configuration: Update the database connection string in the code to point to your PostgreSQL database.
Celery Configuration: Adjust Celery settings in celery_worker.py as needed, including the broker URL and concurrency settings.
Run the Application: Start the Celery worker by running celery -A celery_worker worker --loglevel=info.
## Usage
Collect News Articles: Use the collect_news_articles function to fetch news articles from external sources or feeds.
Process Articles: Pass the collected news articles to the process_article Celery task for asynchronous processing.
View Results: Check the PostgreSQL database to view the processed articles and their assigned categories.
